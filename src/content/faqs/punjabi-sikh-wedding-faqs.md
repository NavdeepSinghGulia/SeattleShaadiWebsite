# Punjabi & Sikh Wedding Planning FAQs - Seattle

*Comprehensive answers to common questions about Punjabi and Sikh wedding planning in Seattle*

## Religious and Cultural Questions

### **Q: What's the difference between a Punjabi wedding and a Sikh wedding?**
**A:** A Sikh wedding includes the religious Anand Karaj ceremony performed at a Gurdwara according to Sikh religious law, while a Punjabi wedding may focus on cultural traditions without the religious ceremony. Many couples choose to have both religious and cultural elements. Sikh weddings must include the four Lavs (rounds around Guru Granth Sahib), while Punjabi cultural weddings may include various regional traditions like Bhangra, traditional music, and cultural ceremonies.

### **Q: Can non-Sikh guests attend the Anand Karaj ceremony at the Gurdwara?**
**A:** Yes, Gurdwaras welcome people of all faiths to witness Sikh ceremonies. All guests must follow Gurdwara guidelines: cover their heads with scarves or turbans, remove shoes before entering the prayer hall, sit on the floor during the ceremony, and maintain respectful behavior. It's a beautiful opportunity for cultural exchange and understanding of Sikh traditions.

### **Q: What are the main Punjabi wedding ceremonies we should include?**
**A:** Traditional Punjabi weddings include:
- **Roka**: Official engagement announcement
- **Sagan/Tilaka**: Formal acceptance ceremony
- **Mehendi**: Henna application celebration
- **Sangeet**: Musical night with dancing and performances
- **Chooda**: Bride receives red and white bangles
- **Anand Karaj**: Religious ceremony (for Sikh couples)
- **Reception**: Community celebration with dinner and dancing

### **Q: How long does the Anand Karaj ceremony take?**
**A:** The complete Anand Karaj ceremony typically takes 2-3 hours, including:
- Kirtan (devotional music) - 30 minutes
- Four Lavs (sacred rounds) - 45-60 minutes
- Ardas (prayers) and speeches - 30 minutes
- Langar (community meal) - 60-90 minutes
Plan for additional time for family photos and the Baraat (groom's procession) arrival.

### **Q: What is Langar and do we need to provide it?**
**A:** Langar is the free community meal served at Gurdwaras to all visitors regardless of background, demonstrating Sikh values of equality and service. Most Gurdwaras coordinate Langar for weddings, either through their community kitchen or by arranging catering. Families typically make a donation to cover costs ($500-1,500 depending on guest count). The meal is always vegetarian and served to everyone attending.

## Venue and Logistics

### **Q: Which Gurdwaras in Seattle area perform wedding ceremonies?**
**A:** Main Gurdwaras serving the Seattle area include:
- **Sikh Temple of Seattle (Renton)**: Large facility with beautiful prayer hall and community spaces
- **Guru Nanak Sikh Temple (Tukwila)**: Established community with experienced ceremony coordination
- **Sikh Gurdwara Singh Sabha (Kent)**: Active community with traditional ceremony services
- **Gurdwara Sahib Spokane**: For Eastern Washington families
Contact Gurdwara committees 6-12 months in advance for wedding bookings.

### **Q: Can we have the reception at the same Gurdwara?**
**A:** Many Gurdwaras have community halls available for receptions, which is convenient and cost-effective. However, some families prefer separate reception venues for larger celebrations or different atmospheres. Gurdwara receptions must follow community guidelines (vegetarian food, no alcohol, appropriate entertainment). Separate venues offer more flexibility for music, dancing, and celebration style.

### **Q: What about alcohol at Punjabi wedding receptions?**
**A:** Alcohol policies depend on your venue and family preferences:
- **Gurdwara venues**: No alcohol permitted on religious premises
- **Community centers**: Policies vary, check with specific venues
- **Hotels and banquet halls**: Usually allow alcohol service
- **Private venues**: Generally allow alcohol with proper permits
Many Punjabi families choose alcohol-free celebrations to honor Sikh values, while others include alcohol at non-religious venues.

### **Q: How do we coordinate the Baraat (groom's procession) in Seattle?**
**A:** Baraat coordination involves:
- **Route planning**: From groom's location to ceremony venue
- **Transportation**: Decorated car for groom, cars/bus for wedding party
- **Dhol players**: Traditional drummers for the procession
- **Timing**: Usually 1-2 hours before ceremony start
- **Permits**: Check if street permits needed for processions
- **Weather backup**: Indoor alternatives for Seattle weather
We coordinate with venues and local authorities for smooth Baraat celebrations.

## Cultural Traditions and Customs

### **Q: What should the bride wear for different Punjabi wedding ceremonies?**
**A:** Traditional Punjabi bridal attire varies by ceremony:
- **Mehendi**: Bright yellow or green outfit, comfortable for henna application
- **Sangeet**: Colorful lehenga or sharara, suitable for dancing
- **Anand Karaj**: Red, maroon, or pink lehenga/salwar kameez with heavy dupatta

Head covering is required for Gurdwara ceremonies. We can recommend local designers and shops for authentic Punjabi bridal wear.

### **Q: What is the significance of Chooda and Kalire?**
**A:** Chooda are red and white bangles given to the bride by her maternal uncle (mama), symbolizing her transition to married life. Kalire are decorative hanging ornaments attached to the Chooda, traditionally made of gold or silver. The bride wears these for several weeks after the wedding. During the Kalire ceremony, unmarried girls try to catch falling Kalire pieces, believing it will bring them marriage soon. This tradition connects the bride to her family and community.
