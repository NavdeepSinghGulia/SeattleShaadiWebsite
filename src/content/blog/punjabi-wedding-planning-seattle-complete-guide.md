## Understanding Punjabi Wedding Traditions

### Core Elements of Punjabi Weddings:

**Religious Significance**
Punjabi weddings often center around the Sikh religious ceremony called Anand Karaj, meaning "blissful union." This sacred ceremony takes place in a Gurdwara (Sikh temple) and involves the couple walking around the Guru Granth Sahib four times while hymns are sung.

**Cultural Celebrations**
Beyond the religious ceremony, Punjabi weddings include vibrant cultural celebrations featuring traditional music, dance, colorful decorations, and elaborate feasts that bring families and communities together.

Punjabi weddings are community affairs where extended families, friends, and neighbors participate in various ceremonies, from preparation to celebration, creating a sense of unity and shared joy.
