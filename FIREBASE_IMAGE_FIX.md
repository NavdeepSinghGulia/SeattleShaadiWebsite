# Firebase Production Image Loading Fix

## Problem
Images loaded correctly in Firebase preview environment but failed to load in Firebase production deployment.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by Next.js image optimization being incompatible with Firebase hosting:

1. **Next.js Image Optimization**: By default, Next.js optimizes images through the `/_next/image` API endpoint
2. **Firebase Hosting Limitation**: Firebase hosting serves static files and cannot handle the Next.js image optimization API
3. **Preview vs Production**: Firebase preview runs with Next.js dev server (which has the API), but production deployment is static

## Solution
Disabled Next.js image optimization by setting `unoptimized: true` in the images configuration:

```typescript
// next.config.ts
images: {
  // ... other config
  unoptimized: true, // Required for Firebase hosting static deployment
}
```

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
- Images were processed through `/_next/image?url=/images/hero/image.jpg&w=640&q=75`
- Firebase production couldn't serve these optimized URLs
- Images failed to load with 404 errors

### After Fix  
- Images now serve directly from `/images/hero/image.jpg`
- No server-side optimization required
- Compatible with Firebase static hosting

## Additional Changes
1. Added graceful fallback for Google Fonts loading to prevent build failures
2. Ensured all API routes are properly configured for static export compatibility

## Trade-offs
- **Lost**: Automatic image optimization, WebP/AVIF conversion, responsive sizing
- **Gained**: Reliable loading in Firebase production, faster deployments, reduced complexity

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Static Export**: Would work but removes other dynamic features
2. **Custom Image CDN**: Adds complexity and cost
3. **Firebase Functions**: Overkill for this use case

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Check that `unoptimized: true` appears in `.next/images-manifest.json`
3. Deploy to Firebase and test image loading in production

## Files Modified
- `next.config.ts` - Set `images.unoptimized: true`
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added graceful font loading fallback
- `src/app/api/sitemap-ping/route.ts` - Added static export compatibility
- `src/app/favicon/route.ts` - Added static export compatibility
